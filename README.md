Hi there üëã

I'm Michael, software engineer from Germany. My official title is _Staff Software Engineer_ and I work at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com).
Titles which theoretically would fit as well "does stuff with or do computers", "break things as a service" and "source of endless rants" üòâ.

I have been working in IT since the early 2000s. My goto language of choice is Java ‚òïÔ∏è and I am a recognized [Java Champion](https://dev.java/community/jcs/)
and published author (["Spring Boot - Moderne Softwareentwicklung im Spring √ñkosystem", DE 2018](http://springbootbuch.de) and 
[arc42 by example, EN 2014 ‚Äì 2015](https://leanpub.com/arc42byexample)). I founded the Java user group [EuregJUG Maas-Rhine](http://euregjug.eu) together with @dl1ely.

I am a Spring User for more than a decade and one of my earliest projects  ([Dailyfratze](https://dailyfratze.de/pages/technical_details?lang=en)) is still around, alive 
and kicking.

I have contributed to broad number of frameworks and ecosystems, such as

* [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commits?author=michael-simons)
* [Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/commits?author=michael-simons)
* [Spring Data JDBC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-relational/commits?author=michael-simons)
* [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/commits?author=michael-simons)
* [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/commits?author=michael-simons)
* [jOOQ](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/commits?author=michael-simons)

Since 2018 I am the maintainer of [Spring Data Neo4j](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j) and [Neo4j-OGM](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm) together
with [@meistermeier](https://github.com/meistermeier).

I created the following projects which I do actively maintain:

* [Cypher-DSL](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl): A query builder for Neo4js query language Cypher, heavily inspired by jOOQ.
* [Neo4j-Migrations](https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations): Database refactoring toolkit for Neo4j, with integrations for Quarkus and Spring Boot and a native CLI
* [biking2](https://github.com/michael-simons/biking2): A project around cycling which I used to learn Spring Boot and educate about Spring Boot
* [scrobbles4j](https://github.com/michael-simons/scrobbles4j): Years of giving talks about relational databases and tracking listening habbits culminated in a life application displaying my latest songs

Last but not least, I have this [Advent of Code](https://github.com/michael-simons/aoc) repository in which I went a bit nuts in terms of programming languages:
I love Java, but I try to stay on top of other things, too.

Apart from all of that, I have a blog [info.michael-simons.eu](https://info.michael-simons.eu), my slides are on [speakerdeck](http://speakerdeck.com/michaelsimons), I answer
stuff on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1547989/michael-simons) and I do have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-simons-196712139/).
However, my primary feed is on Twitter: [@rotnroll666](https://twitter.com/rotnroll666).
