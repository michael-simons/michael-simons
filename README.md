Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael, software engineer from Germany. My official title is _Senior Staff Software Engineer_ and I work at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com).
I am an [iSAQBÂ®](https://www.isaqb.org) certified professional for Software Architecture.
Titles which theoretically would fit as well "does stuff with or do computers", "break things as a service" and "source of endless rants" ðŸ˜‰.
Funny enough, people even let me write books about those things.

I am a Java Champion, a 2024 Oracle ACE Associate and a certified Java professional developer on a bunch of Java versions:
